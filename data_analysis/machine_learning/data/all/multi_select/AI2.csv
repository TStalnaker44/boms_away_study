I should have access to the exact model definition used for the model. If someone is forced to reverse engineer the model, small details may be incorrect, leading to errors. For example, classification heads for image classifiers are usually either in the order of AvgPool2d -> norm -> fc or norm->AvgPool2d -> fc. Reversing the order has no impact on the loading of the model weights, but leads to differences in model performance.
Validation procedures are also potentially in need of documentation, specifically the image preprocessing pipeline used during the validation phase of image classification models should be fully documented such that it is replicable from scratch. I know that cropping procedures, resizing interpolation algorithms, and other small and often-overlooked aspects of deep learning code can have effects on the results.","Optimizers, loss functions, etc.",Model parameters,Known model/data defects,Creation / building time,Data version,Model license
