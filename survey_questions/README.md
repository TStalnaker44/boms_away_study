# Survey Questions

The survey questions are available here in PDF format. The documents were automatically generated by the Qualtrics platform.

Each document consists of a few sections:
- **Survey flow**: this describes the block level logic of the survey.  This includes the logic used to hide or show blocks of questions based on previous responses.  For example, only participants that self-identified as SBOM producers would see questions in the SBOM Producers block.
- **Consent form**: the form that participants were required to sign before continuing
- **Question blocks**: conceptual groupings of similar questions.  The beginning of a block is denoted by `Start of Block: <Block Name>` and a block concludes with `End of Block: <Block Name>`

Question blocks contain the individual questions asked to participants.  Here are some conventions used in the PDF files:
- **Blue block**: a blue block above a question provides the question logic (the condition under which the question will be shown to the survey participant).
- **Asterisk**: an asterisk above a question denotes that an answer is required before the participant can continue.
- **Question ID**: Before the question text, there is a question identifier.  For example, in `S2 Which SBOM format(s) do you use?`, `S2` is the question ID.
- **Dashed lines**: represent the end of a question

### Note on question numbering

For most surveys, the questions are labeled based on the surrounding block and sequentially number based on display order.  This makes discussing and locating the questions much easier.  However, the critical project and CPS surveys were mistakenly published before the questions could be relabeled.  For these cases, the order in which the questions appear in the PDF is also the order they would appear to participants, barring any restrictions in the display logic.
